The Client has identified the following features that need to be implemented within the challenge 1 airport software:

- A representation of the airport is needed in the software that defines the maximum capacity of the number of planes that can be at the airport at any one time
  - This capacity should have the ability to be overridden as appropriate
- Air Traffic Controllers need to be able to:

  - Instruct a plane to land at an airport if the airport is not full and the plane is not already at the airport
  - Instruct a plane to take off from an airport as long as it is currently at the airport

  Extra Requirements:

- Planes must not be able to land if the weather is stormy
- Planes must not be able to take off if the weather is stormy

By implementing the above features this will have many beneficial effects that include:

1.  The program will help control the flow of traffic in and out of the airport
2.  The program will provide a greater efficiency for the Air Traffic Controllers
3.  There will be a clearly defined maximum capacity of planes at the airport at all times
4.  A clear representation of the airport will be produced
5.  There will be both automatic and manual control options as part of the program
6.  Quick identification of airport capacity
7.  Identification of plane already at the airport
8.  More efficient instructions for pilots at time of take off
9.  Potential for improved landing and take off times
10. An extra level of safety for the planes
11. Air Traffic Controllers will be able to control landing and take off procedures if there is bad weather

The challenge 1 airport software will also help to solve problems. Such as:

1. Clear definitions of maximum capacity
2. Air Traffic Controllers can tell where at the planes are at all times
3. Easy operation of software for Air Traffic Controllers including safety overrides
4. Provides instructions to planes seeking to land at the airport - with capacity levels known
5. Provides instructions to planes seeking to take off at the airport
6. Provides log/record of where planes are actually located air/airport
7. Will pause landing and take off procedures immediately if there is bad weather

As with all software there are several potential risks. These include:

1. Manual entry override could be abused causing capacity problems
2. Reliant on accurate source data bring provided by client e.g. planes, airport plans, known capacity
3. Reliant on updates as and when new aircraft need to be added or airport capacities change
